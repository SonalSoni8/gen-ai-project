# API Key Configuration
You'll need API keys for Google Generative AI and Google Maps Places API.
1. Google Generative AI API Key:
Go to Google AI Studio or the Google Cloud Console to create an API key for the Gemini models.
Ensure the API key has permissions to use the desired Gemini model (e.g., gemini-1.5-pro-latest, gemini-2.0-flash). You might need to enable the "Vertex AI API" in your Google Cloud project.

2. Google Maps Places API Key:
Go to the Google Cloud Console.
Create a new project or select an existing one.
Enable the "Places API" for your project.
Create an API key and ensure it's restricted appropriately (e.g., to the Places API and your IP address for development).
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add your API keys:
GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY"
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_PLACES_API_KEY"

Env
* Important: Replace "YOUR_..._API_KEY" with your actual keys. Do not commit your .env file to Git. (It should be covered by the .gitignore file).
